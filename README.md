# Air-quality-analysis
This project acts as a investigation into the state of the state of air quality in the US.

# Guiding Question: 
Throughout this analysis, my main goal was to determine whether or not the US should be concerned about air quality in any regions. 

# Tasks
1. Complete any necessary cleaning of the datasets
2. Begin initial EDA
3. Analyze important relationships to determine which predictors are most indicative of hazardous air quality
4. Determine whether or not the US should be concerned about its air quality

# Results: 
According to our analysis, we determined the US does not need to be concerned about its air quality. This project was concluded in February of 2023. These findings are only indicative of trends found when the dataset was collected.
